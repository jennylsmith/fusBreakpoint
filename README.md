A package to simplify the extraction of fusion junction sequences from RNAseq BAM files, using the Biostrings Bioconductor framework. 

## Usage:

0. You will need the following files as input: 

1. For one sample: 

```

```

2. for multiple samples: 

The best approach is parallelization since each sample and fusion are treated independently.
